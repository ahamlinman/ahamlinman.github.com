I'm Alex, and I work on various programming-related projects in my spare time, including...\r\n\r\n* [The Fruit Sale Service](ahamlinman/Fruit-Sale-Service)\r\n  * A Google App Engine site for tracking a fundraiser. It's not currently in active development and is not designed for use by the general public. I will likely release it into the public domain soon, as I plan to completely rewrite it if the service is used again in the future.\r\n* PyTICalcs\r\n  * A Python extension to make the [TiLP](debrouxl/tilp) libraries available in Python and simpler to use. It was available on GitHub for a short time. However, it has been removed because development has been slower than I had expected. PyTICalcs will be available in the future under version 3+ of the GNU GPL. More information is available at the provided link\r\n* [Color of the Day](http://coloroftheday.zxq.net)\r\n  * A small novelty website written for friends that provides a different color every day. The current implementation is in PHP, though a future implementation will be in Java once I port PHP's Mersenne Twister random number generator. The source code is not currently available (and is not really useful anyways), though I am happy to provide it to anyone who asks.\r\n\r\nMy e-mail address is available on my GitHub profile.","google":"UA-33241172-1","tagline":"...on GitHub!"}
